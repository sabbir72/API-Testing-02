Here we performed API Testing on postman and report generated by newman. API is collected from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11369613/SzmjyaXZ

Here we performed API Testing on postman. We generated two files RESTFUL API.postman_collection.json and RESTFUL API.postman_environment.json. In the first file where all API are assigned and we worked on all the data we received.  In the second file we declare environment variables that connected with our collection file and worked properly. After generating two files we used postman for generating report file. After generating the report we got all the results we found in API Testing.
